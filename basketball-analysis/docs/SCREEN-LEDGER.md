# Screen ledger — one screen at a time, finished, then the next

**Kevin's rule, overriding everything:** do not move on from a screen until it is
100% done. No partial work spread across screens. No coming back later.

> **Rebuilt 2026-08-05 05:20 UTC after a container rollback wiped the scratchpad.**
> The canonical design sets survived; this ledger, the briefs and the capture
> directories did not. Everything below was recovered from the commit messages on
> `main`, which is why the reasoning is written into them. Treat that as the
> lesson: **the scratchpad is not durable — git is.**

## Definition of DONE

1. Every canonical band present, in canonical order, at canonical position.
2. Type: cap height, advance width and ink density measured per ink run.
3. Colour: every role from **eroded stroke cores**, never band medians.
4. Geometry: cards, gutters, rules, bar strokes, icon sizes measured.
5. Imagery: right asset, right crop, right drawn size.
6. No overflow, truncation, overprinting, or one-word-per-line columns.
7. Reachable by a real user path AND deterministically by the harness.
8. Invariants: iOS 393pt wide; desktop 900x1440 with exactly one sidebar.
9. **An independent grader scores it A or A+.** Not "improved".
10. Committed and pushed.

## Order

iOS 001 -> 072, then desktop 077 -> 096.

## Status

| 001 | splash | **DONE** | **A+** | second independent grader; A- refuted, all 3 defects closed |
| 002 | welcome | **DONE** | **A** | fresh grader refuted the A-; 6 defects closed; crossbar residual proven unreachable |

## 003 — independent verification, before the grade

Re-measured from scratch rather than taken from the builder's report. The
measurement script shares no code with its solver.

- `tsc --noEmit` clean. Own production build into `.next-v3`, served on 3192.
- Capture via `ONLY=003`: 1/1, 0 gaps, 0 step failures, 0 wider than 393pt.
- Band alignment at matched threshold 160: **18 ink runs each side, worst
  |dtop| 1 device px, worst |dh| 1, mean dtop -0.06.** No shared sign, so no
  container offset (rule 15).
- Whole-screen mean |d| against canonical **3.772**, reproducing the builder's
  figure exactly by an independent route.
- **Desktop guard clean: 0 pixels differ** from the pre-003 baseline, and 077
  sits identically against canonical (mean 22.547 / 291,046 over 8 / 199,886
  over 32). Desktop DOM reads `rgb(17,17,17)` and `0px`, so the AppleMark and
  GoogleMark leak is closed in pixels and not merely in markup.

**Residual found here, then resolved — and it is NOT a defect, on any screen.**
The render's canvas is 1849 device px tall against canonical's 1844. Chasing it
gave a clean answer: **all 72 canonical PNGs are exactly 853x1844**, so the
canonical artboard is 393x850 pt (850 x 2.170483 = 1844.91), while the real
iPhone viewport this app renders into is 393x**852** pt (852 x 2.170483 =
1849.25). The 5 px is the artboard, not the app.

Consequences, which apply to every iOS screen and not just this one:

- **Never "fix" it.** Shrinking the capture viewport to 850pt to match would be
  gaming the metric against the real device size, and padding is already
  forbidden by the standing rulings.
- **Compare top-anchored, over the first 1844 rows.** Content is top-anchored
  and the ink extents agree exactly (y41-1730 on both sides here). A whole-image
  diff that bottom-anchors or resizes will manufacture a whole-screen offset.
- A grader reporting "the render is 5 px taller" has found the artboard, not a
  defect. Expect it on all 72.

A method note worth keeping: the first pass of this verification used one
permissive threshold and produced five false findings of 100+ px band
displacement, which were canonical's unsharp halo bridging bands the render
keeps separate. Sweeping the threshold (rule 6) collapsed the worst case to
1 device px. Rule 6 is not optional.

## The iOS baseline — 72 screens, and evidence the method works

Full sweep against the current build: **72/72 captured, 72 distinct md5s, 0
gaps, 0 step failures, 0 wider than 393pt.** Per-screen numbers in
`$SCRATCH/verify-ios-full/BASELINE.json`, measured top-anchored over canonical's
1844 rows (see the artboard note above).

The result is the strongest evidence so far that the one-screen-at-a-time method
is doing something real rather than moving numbers around. **The three finished
screens are the three best on the entire set, and it is not close:**

| screen | mean \|d\| | state |
|---|---|---|
| 001 splash | **2.493** | DONE, A+ |
| 003 sign-in | **3.772** | awaiting grade |
| 002 welcome | **6.528** | DONE, A |
| 033 live-form-feedback | 15.109 | best untouched screen |
| … | … | |
| 023 photo-review-crop | 55.018 | worst |

Across all 72 the mean is 30.488 and the median 29.390, so the untouched screens
sit around 30 and the finished ones sit under 7 — a factor of four to twelve.
003 currently measures better than 002, which a fresh grader scored A.

Worklist by distance, worst first: 023 (55.018), 018 (50.024), 060 (49.756),
068 (48.674), 051 (46.947), 053 (46.825), 042 (46.632), 061 (45.199),
055 (44.014), 007 (43.731). Note 018 was already known to have no phone
composition at all — it renders a reflowed desktop tree — and the measurement
independently puts it second worst.

Same caveat as the desktop table: this is a **regression and triage** baseline,
not a grade. A screen is compared to its own earlier capture, and the ordering
tells you where to spend a cycle, nothing more.

## The desktop regression baseline — 20 screens, rebuilt

`$SCRATCH/verify-desktop` now holds all 20 desktop screens captured from the
current build, with per-screen numbers in `BASELINE.json`. It replaces
`grade-web-r9`, which predates the PR #53 merge and therefore reports a
regression on every screen the merge touched. The capture asserts what it always
did: 20 distinct hashes, no overflow, one rail each.

**These numbers are a REGRESSION baseline, not a fidelity score.** They run from
18.058 (096) to 54.195 (094), mean 31.287, where iOS 003 sits at 3.772 — and
that gap is mostly structural, not quality. Canonical puts navigation in a top
bar so its content starts at x=0; this app puts it in a 196px sidebar by
standing ruling, which displaces every screen horizontally. No amount of type
work closes that, and a large absolute mean here means nothing on its own.
Compare a screen only against its own earlier capture.

Byte-identity is the stronger test where it is available. Desktop 077 came back
md5 `69b2184b0f0e7553108d23c2aae71071`, identical to the pre-003 baseline — the
capture harness's own duplicate check flagged it, which is a better proof that
003 changed nothing on desktop than any pixel threshold.

Worst first: 094 (54.195), 084 (43.082), 082 (38.836), 086 (37.867),
087 (35.904). Best: 096 (18.058), 081 (18.950), 095 (20.822).

## Method rules — seventeen, each learned by getting something wrong

1. **Measure in the shipping rasteriser.** `capture-ios.mjs` launches with
   `--font-render-hinting=none`. A bare `chromium.launch()` hints stems to whole
   pixels and shifts advances — that alone produced a false +5px advance defect
   on 001, and explained an entire grader-vs-builder disagreement.
2. **Weight on the GREEN channel.** Chromium applies LCD subpixel AA to some runs
   at some sizes (fringes ~12px and ~21px CSS, neutral at 30px+); canonical is
   greyscale. On luminance such a run reads +7 to +13% heavy — a false defect.
3. **Ink on ORANGE runs on the BLUE channel.** Canonical's orange has B = 0.7-3
   and its black B = 0, so on blue both read as full ink and the measurement is
   colour-independent. On 002 a label read -5.1% on green and was called an
   outlier; on blue all four labels sat at -1.4 to -2.5% and it never was one.
4. **Area-ratio ladder for weight**, not raw density: area at coverage
   .25/.4/.5/.6/.75/.9. Below 1.0 at EVERY level = genuinely light; straddling
   1.0 = matched with a halo difference.
5. **Row-segment then column-segment. Never a fixed crop box or y-window.** A
   solid block adjacent to a run welds them into one row-run — 001's mark plate
   (y535-681) did this twice and produced two false findings of mine.
6. **Match thresholds.** Canonical carries a soft halo a crisper render does not;
   sweep rather than picking one.
7. **Cap height on a stem-only glyph (the I) at 50% coverage** — colour-independent.
8. **Canonical PNGs are unsharp-masked.** A small-type stem reads
   `248 / 255 / [74 85] / 255 / 248`, ringing BOTH sides. Below ~30px an eroded
   stroke core is UNOBTAINABLE — a colour defect reported from one cannot be
   real. Solve small-type colour from total ink at matched geometry, hue fixed by
   an R:G:B ratio over a large sample.
9. **Ladder tops read 0 on grey runs** — canonical has 10-14px above 0.8 coverage
   no flat-colour render can produce. Unsharp-mask overshoot, not ink.
10. **Font weight can silently resolve DOWN.** Boxed registers 400/600/800, so
    `font-medium` (500) rendered as 400 on 001.
11. **Chromium pixel-snaps background boxes to whole CSS pixels.** A rule authored
    at 828.5 device px with a 1.88px height painted at 829.11 / 2.170. Draw
    hairlines as `<rect>` in an SVG whose viewBox is 1 unit = 1 canonical device px.
12. **Text raster positions quantise** to whole device rows, so a cap-top has a
    plateau of reachable values. Probe the plateau and centre inside it.
13. **Prove a residual unreachable with algebra plus the measured alternative.**
    On 002 the display crossbar could not be matched: with font-size f, scaleX s
    and stroke t, the shape parameter r = t/f had to satisfy stem/width ~ 4.95 AND
    crossbar/cap ~ 0.64 — a 3.05x disagreement, invariant under scaleX and scaleY.
    The alternative cut was measured and shown worse. That is what "unreachable"
    must look like, not "I tried and it did not work".
14. **Solve related runs jointly, not one at a time.** Two runs sharing a token
    trade error back and forth indefinitely when tuned separately. On 003 body1
    and remember sat at -5.0% and +5.2% ink through several rounds of
    single-run tuning and closed as soon as they were solved together.
15. **Cap-top deltas that share a sign are ONE container offset.** On 003 five
    unrelated runs at three sizes read -3.32, -4.20, -3.35, -2.67 and -2.02:
    nothing positive. A per-run type error scatters around zero. Fixing that
    with five compensating leading tweaks lands the cap tops and leaves every
    inter-band gap wrong, and a grader measures gaps. After the container fix
    the same runs read +0.22, +0.28, -0.31, -0.32 and +0.33.
16. **A media query scopes CSS; it does not scope an SVG attribute.** 003's
    phone CSS lives in `@media (max-width: 767.98px)` and is genuinely
    desktop-neutral — but two ink corrections were made as markup attributes on
    `AppleMark` and `GoogleMark`, which are shared components, and they painted
    at every viewport. Route the correction through the media query instead: set
    `fill` on the path from inside it, and for a stroke keep `stroke="<colour>"`
    permanently with `stroke-width="0"` in the markup and raise the width only
    inside the query — a zero-width stroke paints nothing.

17. **Ask what STATE canonical is in before measuring a single band.** Canonical
    003 is not an empty sign-in form — it shows a typed address, a 16-character
    password masked to 16 bullets, a green validation ring and two "Looks good."
    lines, all of it live validation that does not exist until the player types.
    Measuring it against a default render compares two different screens, and
    several bands have no counterpart at all. The capture harness now has `fill`
    and `blur` steps for this; put the state in the route map so it is reached
    the way a player reaches it. **Check 004-007 for the same thing before
    starting them** — every form screen is a candidate.

Also: **check the ASSET, not just the CSS** (002 drew an entirely different
photograph at the right size and position), and **a large desktop-guard diff is
often live data** — 1,495 of 1,508 differing pixels on one run were 079's date
string rolling over at midnight.

## Standing rulings

- Never edit the four measurement-tuned type roles in `globals.css`.
- Scope a colour disagreement to the screen; never change a global token — those
  roles carry the 20 desktop screens graded B+.
- Never delete a region or pad dead space to improve a score.
- Never build into a dist dir while a server serves from it.
- State physically unreachable residuals with their numbers rather than forcing
  them and breaking another metric.
- Do not commit a tree that fails `tsc` or a screen that breaks its size invariant.

## The desktop regression guard — how to run it properly

A screen that shares a route with a desktop screen needs a real before/after,
not a diff against whatever capture happens to be lying around. `/signin` draws
both iOS 003 and desktop 077, so 003 was guarded like this:

1. `git worktree add --detach <dir> <commit-before-this-screen>` and symlink
   `node_modules` into it. This gives a true "before" without touching the
   builder's working tree while it is still running.
2. Build both trees into their own `NEXT_DIST_DIR`, serve on their own ports.
3. Capture with a **bare `chromium.launch()`** — `capture-web.mjs` uses no
   flags, and every desktop grade on record was made in that rasteriser. Using
   `--font-render-hinting=none` here (correct for iOS) shifts text and swamps
   the diff. The two harnesses genuinely disagree, so never compare across them.
4. Capture `/signin` **signed out** in its own context, and assert the URL did
   not redirect.
5. Compare BOTH captures to canonical, not just to each other. "Changed" and
   "regressed" are different findings and only the second one matters.

Doing this on 003 separated two effects that a single diff would have blamed on
the screen in progress: 86,798 pixels moved since the last Aug 4 capture, of
which only 163 were the screen's own work.

## Infrastructure notes

- **The canonical sets are in git** at `docs/shotiq/canonical` (iOS 001-072) and
  `docs/shotiq/canonical-desktop` (077-096), with `.gitignore` negations because
  `*.png` is blanket-ignored. Use those, not the scratchpad copies. The builder
  brief template is at `docs/shotiq/SCREEN-BRIEF-TEMPLATE.md`; `BRIEF-002.md`
  was lost in the rollback.
- **The PR #53 merge cost desktop 077 fidelity**, before any 003 work. Against
  canonical it went from mean |d| 21.465 / 281,859 px over 8 (Aug 4) to
  22.547 / 291,046 at `daa0d1a`. That is the phone-shell work. 077 gets its own
  pass in the desktop sequence; it is recorded here so it is not later
  misattributed to whatever screen happens to be in progress.
- **PR #53 is MERGED** (`daa0d1a`). Follow-up work restarts the branch from
  `origin/main`, which is what recovered from the rollback.
- CI needs Node 22 (package.json declares `engines: >=22`), runs the Capacitor
  sync before tests with `NODE_ENV=production`, and mocks `prisma.shotEvent`.
- **The Pages deploy is blocked on a repo setting only Kevin can change:**
  Settings -> Pages -> Source = "GitHub Actions". The build compiles fine and
  fails at `configure-pages` with "Resource not accessible by integration".
- Capture harnesses (`capture-ios.mjs`, `capture-web.mjs`) and the grade
  directories were lost in the rollback and must be rebuilt before the next
  grading pass.
