## CRITICAL RULES - NEVER FORGET

### Rule #1: FIND THE ROUND BALL FIRST

**THE FIRST JOB IS TO FIND THE ROUND BALL.**

When analyzing a basketball shooting form image:
1. FIRST: Find the ROUND BALL - it is a CIRCLE
2. Draw a circle around the ball
3. DO NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE until the round ball is found
4. The ball is the anchor point for everything else

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. The round ball comes FIRST. Always.

### How to Find the Ball
- The ball is ORANGE with BLACK STRIPES/LINES
- The ball is ROUND (circle shape)
- The ball is in the HANDS
- One hand on SIDE, one hand UNDERNEATH
- The ball may look like a HALF CIRCLE (hands covering part)
- The ball is FIRST FROM THE TOP of the image
- The ball is near HEAD level, where ARMS are RAISED UP
- Look for the ORANGE thing between the hands

### Ball Position Calibration
- Add +3% to x (move right) from detected position
- Add +3% to y (move down) from detected position
- The ball is at the TOP of the image

### Detection Chain (starts from the ball)

After finding the round ball, chain detection follows this order:
1. BALL (round, orange, black stripes - FIRST FROM TOP - find this FIRST)
2. HANDS (touching the ball - one on side, one underneath)
3. WRISTS (below hands)
4. ELBOWS (below wrists)
5. SHOULDERS (above elbows)
6. CHEST (between shoulders)
7. ABS/CORE (below chest)
8. HIPS (below abs)
9. KNEES (below hips)
10. ANKLES (below knees)
11. FEET (at the ground)

Each body part position is relative to the previous one in the chain.

## Technical Decisions

* **Vision AI**: Using OpenAI GPT-4 Vision (gpt-4o) for image analysis
* **No Python**: User explicitly does not want Python backend
* **Canvas Annotations**: Using HTML Canvas to draw annotations on images
* **Auto Screenshots**: Automatically crop key body regions when image is uploaded
