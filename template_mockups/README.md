## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### Skeleton Overlay
The skeleton overlay in these mockups is manually positioned for demonstration. 
In a production system, this would use:
- **Pose detection**: MediaPipe, OpenPose, or similar
- **Joint tracking**: Real-time body keypoint detection
- **Biomechanical analysis**: Angle calculations from joint positions

### Form Analysis
The metrics and feedback are based on:
- Standard basketball shooting form principles
- Biomechanical best practices
- Common coaching techniques
- Professional player analysis
